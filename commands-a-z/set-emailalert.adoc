The `set emailAlert` command configures the email to send an email to a specified technical support or organization. The email alert contains a summary of the event, detailed information about the affected storage, and customer contact information.

== Supported Arrays

This command applies to the E2800, E5700, EF600, and EF300 storage arrays. However, you can use the command as an SMcli command, not a script command, for E2700 or E5600 arrays. In this case, the command applies to all of the arrays in the management domain.
