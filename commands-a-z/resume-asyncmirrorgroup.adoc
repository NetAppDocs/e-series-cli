[.lead]
The `resume asyncMirrorGroup` command resumes data transfer between all mirrored pairs in an asynchronous mirror group.

== Supported Arrays

This command applies to any individual storage array, including the E2700, E5600, E2800, E5700, EF600, and EF300 arrays, as long as all SMcli packages are installed.

== Roles

To execute this command on an E2800, E5700, EF600, or EF300 storage array, you must have the Storage Admin role.

== Context

Data written to the primary volumes while the asynchronous mirror group was suspended is written to the secondary volumes immediately. Periodic synchronization resumes if an automatic synchronization interval has been set.
