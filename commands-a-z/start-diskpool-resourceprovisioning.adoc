[.lead]
The `start diskPool resourceProvisioning` command enables resource provisioning on a given disk pool and starts a resource provisioning enablement asynchronous operation on each volume in the disk pool. Resource provisioning requires that all the drives in the disk pool support NVMe's DULBE feature.

== Supported Arrays

This command applies to any individual storage array, including the EF600 and EF300 arrays; as long as all SMcli packages are installed.

== Roles

To execute this command on an EF600 and EF300 storage array, you must have the Storage Admin role.

== Context

To disable resource provisioning on a disk pool, use the full provisioning command with the option to disable resource provisioning. A disk pool will be resource provisioned when created if all the drives are DULBE capable and the storage array's `resourceProvisionedVolumes` setting is `true`.
