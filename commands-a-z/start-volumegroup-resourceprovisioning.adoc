[.lead]
The `start volumeGroup resourceProvisioning` command enables resource provisioning on a given volume group and starts a resource provisioning enablement asynchronous operation on each volume in the volume group. Resource provisioning requires that all the drives in the volume group support NVMe's DULBE feature.

== Supported Arrays

This command applies to any individual storage array, including the EF600 and EF300 arrays; as long as all SMcli packages are installed.

== Roles

To execute this command on an EF600 and EF300 storage array, you must have the Storage Admin or Support Admin roles.

== Context

To disable resource provisioning on a volume group, use the full provisioning command with the option to disable resource provisioning. A volume group will be resource provisioned when created if all the drives are DULBE capable and the storage array's `resourceProvisionedVolumes` setting is `true`.
