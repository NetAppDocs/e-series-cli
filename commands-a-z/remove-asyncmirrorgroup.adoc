[.lead]
The `remove asyncMirrorGroup` command removes an orphaned mirrored pair volume on the storage array.

== Supported Arrays

This command applies to any individual storage array, including the E2700, E5600, E2800, E5700, EF600, and EF300 arrays, as long as all SMcli packages are installed.

== Roles

To execute this command on an E2800, E5700, EF600, or EF300 storage array, you must have the Storage Admin role.

== Context

An orphaned mirrored pair volume exists when a member volume in an asynchronous mirror group has been removed on one side of the asynchronous mirror group (either the primary side or secondary side) but not on the other side.

Orphan mirrored pair volumes are detected when inter-controller communication is restored and the two sides of the mirror configuration reconcile mirror parameters.

Use this command when the mirror relationship is successfully removed on the local or remote storage array, but cannot be removed on the corresponding storage array because of a communication problem.
