The `SMcli enable autoSupportFeature` command turns on the AutoSupport (ASUP) feature for all managed storage arrays and makes it possible to transmit messages to the technical support site. After you enable the ASUP feature, any ASUP-capable storage array is automatically prepared to collect and send support-related data to technical support. The data can then be used for remote troubleshooting and problem analysis.

This command impacts all ASUP-capable storage arrays in the management domain. After enabling this feature for the management domain, you have control over the feature enablement for each storage array.

After enabling this feature, you can next enable the AutoSupport OnDemand feature (if desired), and then enable the AutoSupport Remote Diagnostics feature (if desired). You must enable the three features in this order.
