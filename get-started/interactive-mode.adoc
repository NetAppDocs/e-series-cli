Interactive mode lets you run individual commands without prefixing the commands with `SMcli`.

If you enter `SMcli` and a storage array name, but do not specify CLI parameters, script commands, or a script file, the command line interface runs in interactive mode.

In interactive mode, you can enter a single command, view the results, and enter the next command without typing the complete `SMcli` string. Interactive mode is useful for determining configuration errors and quickly testing configuration changes.

To end an interactive mode session, type the operating system-specific command. For Linux, this key combination is *Control-D*. For Windows, this key combination is *Control-Z + ENTER*.
