== Roles

To execute this command on an E2800, E5700, EF600, or EF300 storage array, you must have the Storage Admin role.

== Syntax

----
delete cgSnapImage consistencyGroup="consistencyGroupName"
[deleteCount=numberOfSnapImages]
[retainCount=numberOfSnapImages]
[ignoreSnapVolume=(TRUE | FALSE)]

== Parameters

|===
| Parameter| Description
a|
`consistencyGroup`
a|
The name of the consistency group from which you want to delete the snapshot images. Enclose the consistency group name in double quotation marks (" ").
a|
`deleteCount`
a|
The number of snapshot images that you want to delete from the consistency group. Use integer values.

This parameter deletes the oldest snapshot image first and continues to delete the oldest snapshot images until reaching the number that you enter.

a|
`retainCount`
a|
The number of snapshot images that you want to keep in the consistency group. Use integer values.

This parameter keeps the most recent snapshot images in the consistency group.

a|
`ignoreSnapVolume`
a|
Determines whether the associated consistency group snapshot volume is kept or deleted. This parameter applies only if the consistency group snapshot image is associated with a consistency group snapshot volume. To keep the snapshot volume, set this parameter to `TRUE`. To delete the snapshot volume, set this parameter to `FALSE`. The default value is `FALSE`.
|===

== Notes

If the snapshot images cannot be deleted for all of the relevant member volumes of the consistency group, the operation fails and none of the snapshot images are deleted.

When you delete a consistency group snapshot image that is associated with a consistency group snapshot volume, the corresponding snapshot volume member in the consistency group snapshot volume are transitioned to the Stopped state. A snapshot volume member in the Stopped state no longer has a relationship to the snapshot group of the deleted snapshot image. However, a snapshot volume member in the Stopped state keeps its relationship to its consistency group snapshot volume.
